<h2>About Me</h2>
I am currently a software engineering student participating in the self-paced bootcamp at Flatiron School, where I have learned Ruby and Rails and am building on my self-taught skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from Shippensburg University of PA, and I have worked in the past as a social worker. I have been building websites for fun since high school, and decided to persue web development as a career after leaving social work to raise my two young children, who are now in elementary school. I have spent the last year learning not just the languages needed to meet that goal, but also the tools and culture surrounding them, while at the same time guiding my kids through their own online learning. Web accessibility is next on my list of things to learn, and I'm planning to take a deep dive into that once I finish up my bootcamp program.
